## Teaching data analysis using R at the DHBW in Mannheim 2025
This repository contains the materials for the course "Data Analysis with R" at the DHBW Mannheim. 
The course is designed to introduce students to data analysis using R, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications.

Data is the basis for many things: reports, decisions, AI models, etc. However, data is never available in a clean form.
Data must therefore be carefully analysed before further use and then converted into a clean (tidy) form.
The programming language R is ideal for these analyses. It contains many tools for statistical and graphical analyses and, with the tidy-tools
a perfect library for cleansing data. All analyses are carried out according to the principles of reproducible research using
literate programming in RMarkdown.    

In the course, all the content presented is worked through together. Ready-made RMarkdown (Quarto) scripts will then be produced for each lesson,
which summarise the content and can be used for your own experiments.
